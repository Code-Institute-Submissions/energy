# Energy of the Future

The goal for this project was to create a website highlighting renewable energy as the best way forward for powering the globe.It was designed to resemble the media rich longform articles increasingly popular in journalism and in organizational branded content.



## Built With
* Flask



## Notes
* Development of the project mostly took place in several other workspaces so it is lacking in a complete commit history. 

* The decision was made to keep the navbar collapsed for all screen sizes as it best suites the aesthetic of the site.
